##Description
Application main purpose is to display content material for both public and private view. The content can include media files or documentation. Users can sign up as a creator or as  a viewer. The viewers do not have to sign up to view content created by other users (every creator is also a viewer but not every viewer is a creator). The creators can add, edit or remove content as they please. Content creation should be similar to Chegg or Stack overflow.
